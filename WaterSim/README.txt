Running Water Simulation
-------------------------

The only thing that Water Simulation Requires in order to run properly is 
the newest version of boost (I didn't include it in the upload because it 
was much to large) in the same directory as the Smoke Simulation project. 
Other than that everything else should be already included.

The Main Project is located in water_sim.

Keyboard Shortcuts (Changes from Smoke Sim):

f - fluid region preview
l - level set marching cubes opengl preview
m - marker particle marching cubes preview
